        <p>
          Thousands of UCLA students have called Kerckhoff Hall home for the
          past century. In that time, the Daily Bruin has trained young
          journalists and produced generations of media-savvy Bruins. As the
          organization enters its second century, we want to support and foster
          that endeavor.
        </p>
        <h3>Mission</h3>
        <p>
          The Daily Bruin Alumni Network will actively engage the alumni of the
          Daily Bruin to serve as a robust community for all former staff
          members, in support of each other and The Bruin. The DBAN will provide
          funding, mentorship and professional development programs for aspiring
          student-journalists at UCLA, ensuring the excellence and longevity of
          The Bruin. The DBAN will encourage students to reach beyond UCLA,
          supporting community programs to advance news literacy and the free
          press.

      <HomePageSection title="Give Back">
        <p>
          The Daily Bruin, like media organizations across the country, has
          faced significant financial challenges as advertising revenue
          continues to drop. Support from alumni allows the organization to
          bolster its reporting through travel, equipment and scholarship
          opportunities.

There’s never been a more important time to promote these attributes."
